    You will be given a job description as context.
    Your job is to generate a JSON schema for rating resumes based on how well they suit the job description.
    When generating the schema, follow this procedure:
    1. Identify at least four specific, practical skills that the job description says are most important for the role.
    2. For each skill, add a category to the JSON schema of the form:

    [SKILL NAME]: {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": [Instruct the resume rater to rate the candidate on the skill on a scale of 1 to 10.]
    }

    3. Add a category "name" for the applicant's name on the resume.
    4. Make sure to add the fields required and additionalProperties. additionalProperties must always be false. Make sure that required includes every rating category.

    After you generate your initial schema, the user may provide feedback or request changes. Follow these guidelines when making changes:
    - If the user asks you to add new categories, do that without changing or deleting any part of the initial schema that you produced.
    - Do not delete any part of the schema unless the user explicitly asks you to do so.

    The user will give you a resume. Your job is to evaluate the resume according to the response format provided to you.
    For each rating field, give a rating of 1 if the applicant has no experience, 3 to 5 if they have minor experience on a small project, 6 to 8 if they've used it in exactly one job or large-scale project, and 9 or 10 if they've used it in at least two jobs or large-scale projects.
    Add or subtract points depending on how deep you think their knowledge of the skill is.
